Proof of Concept Using Shellsort Algorithm
=========================
[Proof of Concept Using Shellsort Algorithm] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellsort) Implementation on Log Detection Using Universal Key Expression.

The algorithm performs sorting and matching by swapping elements for traceroute navigation based on key pattern regression.

The implementation contains two processes of **iteration** and **extraction** on each virtual list of elements demonstrated as follow:

* `delta1`:`(L) is the number of each virtual list value in a giving log file`.
* `delta2`:`Breaking each value into L/2 of vlist in a giving log file`.

###### Hypothesis Method:

Build based on worse case performance.

######Proof 1 Exploit the log:
The above hypothesis is demonstrated for the use of different logs structures, the demonstration is not necessary always true, but this is almost always true in practice once simulated, the illustration in the example is keen to exploit the properties of multiple logs structure by using the concept of shellsort algorithm, which allow us to compare the non-adjacent structure of a giving log value on virtual list (vlist) and exploiting the structure/elements when performing insertion sort.

######Proof 2 Sorting for fewer:
Once the elements take place in adjacent order, two steps of iteration identically used to infiltrate the process, first the effect of exploitation from a direct route node attempting to infiltrate the time process assigned on identical detection match, by equalizing output extraction time based on key regression pattern structure, the second exploitation process uses the left bond of second elements /structure on detection and reverse engineer the extraction match, this recursive iteration process requires pattern matching in the first detection phase, it can be separate or universal process.

######Thinking Recursively using Bounds Proof technique: 
The following technique is demonstrated in the paper in order to simulate the analysis process execution of dedicated hypothesis proof discovery into four closing scenarios:

* Direct Route is not keen to the simulated pattern.
* True access considered as Simi threat ( at least one element found).
* False access considered non-threat.
* True access considered as a threat.

Implementation only provided for small scenario's, needs more work.
