Proof of Concept Using Shellsort Algorithm

=========================

[Proof of Concept Using Shellsort Algorithm] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellsort) implementation .

The algorithm performs sorting and matching by swaping elements for traceroute navigation based on pattern regression.

Implementaion contains two proceess of iteration , saperated on each virtual list of elements demonstrated as follow:

1-(L) is the number of each virtual list value in a giving log file. 
2- Breaking each value into L/2 of vlist in a giving log file.

Proof 1 Exploit the log:
In this example the alert log is not necessary always true, but this is almost always true in practice. The illustration in the example is keen to exploit the properties of a giving implementation using shellsort algorithm.

Proof 2 Sorting for fewer:
Contains two steps of iteration, exploit from a direct route (attempting to infiltrate the time process (by matching a giving regression pattern).


Thinking Recursively using Bounds Proof technique: 
-Direct Route is not keen to simulated pattern.
-True access considered as Simi threat ( at least one element found).
-False access considered non threat.
-True access considered as threat.

Implmentation only provided for small senarios, needs more work.
