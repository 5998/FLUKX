Proof of Concept Using Shellsort Algorithm
=========================
[Proof of Concept Using Shellsort Algorithm] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellsort) Implementation on Log Detection Using Universal Key Expression.

The algorithm performs sorting and matching by swapping elements for traceroute navigation based on key pattern regression.

The implementation contains two processes of **iteration** and **extraction** on each virtual list of elements demonstrated as follow:

* `delta1`:`(L) is the number of each virtual list value in a giving log file`.
* `delta2`:`Breaking each value into L/2 of vlist in a giving log file`.

###### Hypothesis Method:

######Proof 1 Exploit the log:
Examples are demonstrated on alert log is not necessary always true, but this is almost always true in practice,t he illustration in the example is keen to exploit the properties of multipal logs using the concept of shellsort algorithm.

######Proof 2 Sorting for fewer:
Contains two steps of iteration, exploit from a direct route (attempting to infiltrate the time process (by matching a giving regression pattern).

######Thinking Recursively using Bounds Proof technique: 
* Direct Route is not keen to the simulated pattern.
* True access considered as Simi threat ( at least one element found).
* False access considered non-threat.
* True access considered as a threat.

Implementation only provided for small scenario's, needs more work.
